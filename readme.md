#  This is a modification from:
https://github.com/burkeazbill/docker-coredns to suit my purpose.

Modifications made:
- changed docker-compse and Dockerfile a bit
- added a block in Corefile so other domains get resolved by 8.8.8.8 and 9.9.9.9
- also changed domain from example.com to osp.com.  
- db.osp.com has A Name, C Name and A Name entries with multiple IP examples

# Some additional notes:
UDP 53  is used by resolv.comf, so docker container won't be able to map 53:53/udp on base system.

reference: https://medium.com/@niktrix/getting-rid-of-systemd-resolved-consuming-port-53-605f0234f32f

on the base ubuntu system do the following:
- sudo systemctl stop systemd-resolved
```bash
sudo systemctl stop systemd-resolved
```

- sudo systemctl disable systemd-resolved
```bash
sudo systemctl disable systemd-resolved
```
- vi /etc/systemd/resolved.conf and make it look like below (commet all lines except for the last 2):

```bash
vi /etc/systemd/resolved.conf

# Docker CoreDNS

## Overview

Need a lightweight, simple, container-based DNS server for your home or lab environment? Here it is! [CoreDNS](http://www.coredns.io). This docker based container image weighs in at a whopping 32.9MB ! That's it!

## Instructions

Choose which format file you wish to use:

- hosts file
- DNS Zone file

I've provided an example of each in the config folder.

Edit the config/Corefile as follows:

- Rename the file it is referencing to match your domain (change the example.com part of the filename to yourdomain.whatever)
- Uncomment the file type you wish to use (hosts/file)

Next, edit the zone file (db.example.com) or hosts file (example.com.hosts), adding entries for eacy of your hosts in the respective format.

Once you're done, simply type the following command to run the container in daemon mode (requires docker-compose):

```plain
docker-compose up -d

or 

docker compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

Prefer to simply run docker from the command line? Example shows call for latest image. 

```plain
docker run -m 128m --expose=53 --expose=53/udp -p 53:53 -p 53:53/udp -v "$PWD"/config:/etc/coredns --name coredns burkeazbill/docker-coredns -conf /etc/coredns/Corefile
```

## Test the DNS

You can confirm the dns is working with dig as follows, from the host running the container. Assuming you simply run the command line above without any modifications, you can use this:

```plain
dig @localhost gateway.example.com
```

This should result in the output including an ANSWER SECTION that shows gateway.example.com resolves to 192.168.1.1 as follows:

```plain
$ dig @localhost gateway.example.com


; <<>> DiG 9.10.6 <<>> @localhost gateway.example.com
; (2 servers found)
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 47780

;; AUTHORITY SECTION:

Quick steps to install docker & docker-compose on Ubuntu:
---------------------------------------------------------

sudo -i
apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y
echo net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 >> /etc/sysctl.conf
sysctl -p
sudo sysctl --system
exit
sudo apt install docker.io -y
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
exit # and ssh back in for this to work
docker --version
sudo apt install docker-compose -y
```
# Next Steps
once cloned change directory to "coredns_docker-compose" Here you will see the following.

   - docker-compose.yml
   - Dockerfile
   - config directory

Change directory to the config directory. 
  - vi "Corefile" and change the line  "file /etc/coredns/db.osp.com osp.com" to "file /etc/coredns/db.onprem.com onprem.com"  Here onprem.com is your domain
  - now rename db.osp.com to db.onprem.com and vi db.onprem.com to put in your DNS records 

ðŸ“™ Corefile has a line that forwards to /etc/resolv.conf    This is used if there is no entry in db.onprem.com

The final files in that directory should be like shown in the figure below.

now build and bring up the container with the command
```
docker-compose up -d
```
